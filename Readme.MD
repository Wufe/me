## Info  

This code was based upon  

+ Pluralsight's ["RESTful Web Services with PHP and Laravel"](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/php-laravel-restful-web-services/table-of-contents)  
+ Devdojo's ["Laravel 5.3 basics"](https://devdojo.com/series/laravel-5-3-basics)  
+ Pluralsight's ["Continuous Delivery Using Docker And Ansible"](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/docker-ansible-continuous-delivery/table-of-contents)

It was a repo used to study Laravel and continuous delivery workflow.  
The code evolved into a personal project.
